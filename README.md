#What does it do

We begin by creating database tables that will hold the values of CSV files. The CSV are fetched from a french open data site they represent data of sport equipment in the region of Nantes.
Once the data is inserted into the database, the web service display a page allowing the user to search for a sport. Once the user inputed the city the webservice will generate a page listing the different equipment where the sport is available.
The result are also grouped on a map using leaflet.
